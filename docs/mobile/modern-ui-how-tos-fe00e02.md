# Modern UI How-Tos

The following sections introduce the features of the Document Management Service Modern UI.

The UI is available for Intel-based tablets running on Microsoft Windows 8.1 on which the Document Management Service desktop app is installed. The desktop app synchronizes the files and folders and the Modern UI presents them in a more touch-friendly way.

The Document Management Service Modern UI is a roll-out, read-only view of the desktop app and enables you to do the following:

-   Navigate through local files and folders, which are synced by the Document Management Service desktop app
-   Use breadcrumb navigation in folder hierarchies
-   Sort document lists inside folders
-   Search for files based on their name
