# Viewing and Editing Properties of Files and Folders \(Android\)

In the SAP Document Management Service mobile app you can view the properties of a file or a folder and edit some of these properties.



## Context

The CMIS standard defines which of the general properties can be edited and the server administrator determines which of the custom properties can be edited. The file and folder properties are grouped into the following categories:

-   *General Properties*

    The *General Properties* provide the following information about a file or a folder:

    -   Description and type
    -   Size
    -   Date of creation
    -   Author
    -   Date of modification
    -   Editor

-   *Custom Properties*

    The *Custom Properties* provide more technical details, which depend on the repository and are grouped by namespace and secondary type.
