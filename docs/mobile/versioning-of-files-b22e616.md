# Versioning of Files

The Document Management Service Desktop app enables you to create new versions of a file, and edit latest version of the file. Versioning in Document Management Service is also helpful for teamwork, where you're collaborating with colleagues on projects and the content goes through several iterations of improvement and review. This way, you can track the file history and the development of the final version.



## Prerequisites

-   Your administrator has set up repository in *Document Management Service Admin*.
-   Your administrator has set up your repository as versioned in the CMS back-end system for other repositories.



## Procedure

1.  Choose the file for which you want to create a new version.

2.  Right-click on the document and select *Check Out*.

    If you edit a document without checking out, it's checked out automatically.

3.  You can edit the file offline, or while online. When you're done with your changes, right-click on the document and select *Check In* to make the updated document visible to others.

    A pop-up window appears where you can set the new version to major or minor, and leave comments. Select *OK* when done.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you don't wish to create a new file version, and want to undo your changes, select *Cancel Checkout*.
    > 
    > In Web App, select the *Properties* icon. The *Document Versions* tab shows details of the existing file versions, and permitted actions.
