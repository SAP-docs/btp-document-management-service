<a name="loioa7e420935ba14947b42ab9f0164c11bf__context_v1f_lhy_zy"/>

## Context

With the iOS app, you can create a share for files you selected in *Repository* or you can create an empty share in *Collaboration*. Either way, creating a share involves the same steps. For a complete description for sharing files that are located in the *Repository*, see [Sharing Files](sharing-files-3907e7c.md).

To create an empty share, see the steps below.



<a name="loioa7e420935ba14947b42ab9f0164c11bf__steps_w1f_lhy_zy"/>

## Procedure

1.  Open *Shared Documents*, and choose *Add* \> *Create*.

2.  Enter a name for the share in the *Share Name* field and optionally a description in the *Share Description* field.

    > ### Note:  
    > Be aware that this name is visible to the people you send the link to.

3.  Define the options for your share:You can work on this share privately first or grant access and create a public link right away using *Anyone with the link has access*. If you set *Anyone with the link has access*, define the options for your share:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Option
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Expires in *<number\>* days* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Defines when the access to the share expires. If the expiration period times outand you have not defined a date for automatic deletion, the share won't be removed. You as the share owner or a share administrator can extend this period.

    If your administrator has defined a default validity period for public links, the remaining days and the end date are displayed. If your administrator has not defined a validity period, the link is accessible indefinitely. In any case, the maximum validity you can set is the default set by the administrator. If there's no default, you can set any number of days.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Write permission* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Enables users to upload files to the share, and to change or delete files in the share. Your administrator can restrict the use of this setting. If you grant write permission, you can in addition select to hide uploaded files from external users by selecting *Hide uploaded files*. This is to ensure that external users can only see the share but no uploaded files. 
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Password protection* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Lets you set a password for accessing the link to the share. The administrator configures whether you need to specify a password and which criteria it must meet, for example, a minimum length.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  Choose *Create*.
