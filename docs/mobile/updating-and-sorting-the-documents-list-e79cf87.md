# **Updating and Sorting the Documents List**

The SAP Document Management app refreshes the list of documents whenever you navigate to a folder.

## Context

To display changes that have occurred on the server or your mobile device, you need to update the documents list to view the synchronization result.



## Procedure

1.  To refresh the list manually, pull down on the list and release it when:

    -   **Refreshing the Repository List:** Updates your view so that you're seeing the most current list of repositories in the mobile app.
    -   **Updating Folders:** Refresh when you're inside a specific folder. This action triggers a synchronization process - it uploads any changes made locally on your device to the server and downloads any new changes from the server to your device.

2.  To sort the list of files and folders inside a repository, choose one of the <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‚•</span> Sort criteria from the dropdown list:

    -   *Name*
    -   *Object Type*
    -   *Creation Date*
    -   *Modification Date*
    -   *File Size*

    By default, the files and folders are sorted by name, with the folder names before the file names.
