# Editing PDF Files on iOS

In the SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents iOS client you can easily annotate PDF files or fill in PDF forms. However, you can only work on editable PDFs and cannot change the text of the PDF itself.



## Procedure

1.  To edit a PDF file, open it and chose *Display Toolbar* \(![](images/PSPDT_Edit_0506cc9.png)\) from the header.

    The toolbar of the PSPDF kit is displayed and offers several annotation types, for example:

    -   Highlight text
    -   Add a text box
    -   Add a note
    -   Use a pencil
    -   Insert a photo

        Click the image icon, choose *Camera* to take a new photo or *Photo Library* to use an existing photo.

    -   Select a part of the PDF with the selection tool
    -   Erase pencil marks

2.  To save your changes, choose *Save*.

3.  To exit the PDF, choose *Back*.
