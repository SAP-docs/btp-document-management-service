# Viewing and Editing Properties of Files, Folders, and Shares

In the SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents Web app you can view and edit the properties of a file or folder.



## Context

The CMIS standard defines which of the general properties can be edited and the server administrator determines which of the custom properties can be edited. The file, folder, or share properties are grouped into the following categories:

-   *General Properties*
-   *Custom Properties* 
-   *Document Versions* \(available for files from a versioned repository\)
-   *Access Settings of Share* \(available for shares in *Shared Documents*\)

There is a separate property for document classification, which is set with the default classification of the respective repository. Its possible values are *public*, *customer*, *internal*, *confidential*, and *strictly confidential*.



## Procedure

1.  To view the properties of a file or folder, choose the *Properties* icon \(![](images/Web_Icon_Properties_910e577.png)\). To view the properties of a share, choose the *Access Settings of Share* icon \(![](images/Web_Icon_Group_77198e9.png)\).

    -   On the *General Properties* tab, you find more information about a file or folder relevant to its description, size, date of creation, author, date of modification, editor, and file type \(if the resource is a file\). You can also view and use the automatically generated Web and mobile links to the file or folder.
    -   On the *Custom Properties* tab, you find more technical details, which are specific to the repository and are grouped by namespace and secondary type.
    -   On the *Document Versions* tab, you find information about the file version, name, editor, date of modification, and comments left after editing.
    -   On the *Access Settings of Share* tab, you find the link to the share, the sharing settings, and for shares with members also the list of share members and their roles.

2.  To edit the description or the properties of a file or folder, view its description or properties and switch to edit mode by choosing *Edit*.

3.  Save your changes by choosing *Save*.
