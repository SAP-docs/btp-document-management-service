# Editing and Viewing Files Using Microsoft Office

You can view and modify Microsoft Office files directly using the native Office programs without explicitly downloading them beforehand.



## Prerequisites

-   To edit files, you must have editing permission for the folder or share in which the file resides. Without this permission, you can still view such files.

-   You have uploaded a Microsoft Office file, for example, a Word document or an Excel sheet.




## Procedure

1.  Select the Microsoft Office file you want to edit.

2.  Choose *Edit*.

3.  Edit your file in the Microsoft Office application that opens.

4.  Save your file.




## Results

The changes to your file have been saved on the server.
