# Searching for Files and Folders \(Android\)

The SAP Document Management Service mobile app enables you to search offline and online for files and folders in any repository and browse the search results quickly and easily.



## Context

If you want to search using wild cards, it is good to know that \*, ?, %, and \_ are treated as characters only. Double quotes \("\) can be used to start and end phrases. If your input contains an uneven number of double quotes, a trailing double quote is assumed.

## Procedure

1.  You can trigger the search for files and folders using the *Search* field as follows:

    Touch the magnifier next to the repository name.

2.  Insert the keywords in the *Search* field and tap the *Search* button, or by scanning a QR code/ Bar code by tapping the action ![](images/QRCode_51cc824.png).

    The search results are displayed under two tabs for files and folders as lists of files and folders that contain the searched keywords in their names.

    > ### Note:  
    > The offline and online searches are separated. The app triggers either an offline or an online search. If you are connected to the Internet, the online search is triggered, otherwise only an offline search is available. Offline and online results are not merged.

3.  Navigate to a file or folder from the search list to see the content of this file or folder.

    -   If you choose the *Files* tab to review a certain file and then tap the browser back button, the search result list is displayed again.
    -   If you choose the *Folder* tab to review a certain folder and its content and then tap the browser back button, you go to the search results.

    -   If you search for files in offline mode, some of the documents that have not yet been downloaded or synchronized will not be available for review.
