Documents can be tagged with keywords to provide context. These tags are stored as **sap:tags** property of the document.

## Prerequisites

You must have write access to the file. Tagging is only supported for documents stored in *My Documents*, *Shared Documents*, or the SAP Document Service based *Corporate Repository*.



## Procedure

1.  Select the *Properties* icon \(![](images/Web_Icon_Properties_910e577.png)\) next to the document.

2.  Select *Edit* on the bottom of the page, and then add keywords for the document in the *Tags* field. You can add multiple tags separated by commas.

3.  Choose *Save* to save your changes.

    The document can now be identified with the new tags saved in its properties.
