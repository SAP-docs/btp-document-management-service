# Synchronizing Files Automatically \(Android\)

The mobile apps of SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents can keep your files up to date on your device, even if you do not access the files. In addition, the files are still available when you are offline and have no network access.



## Prerequisites

When offline, you can mark files and folders for offline access, but you need to be online for the sync setting to take effect.



## Context

You can select files or folders for synchronization so that they are always up to date on your device. Without this setting, updated files or folders are downloaded when you open them, assuming that a network connection is available at that time.

If you synchronize a folder, the files contained in that folder may be removed or new files may appear, depending on the changes reflected by the server.

The difference between syncing and local caching of an accessed file on the device is that only the sync guarantees that the file is kept on the device and in sync.

> ### Note:  
> If you have activated the *Sync All My Documents* app setting on your device, the setting described below is already active.

## Procedure

1.  In any of the folders, select one or more files or subfolders.

2.  Under the *Actions* buttons, set the *Sync* switch to *On*.




## Results

The selected files or, in the case of a folder, all files and subfolders within it, are flagged for download and synchronization. Files that you have never viewed are marked with a blue dot before the file name, which symbolizes the file as unread. If the file or folder is changed, the app automatically downloads the latest version again and marks changed files again with a blue dot.

> ### Note:  
> To save costs and avoid long load times, reduce traffic on your cellular by turning off automatic synchronization if you do not have a data flatrate and are not connected to a Wi-Fi network. You can still access all files, but they are not automatically downloaded.
> 
> To automatically sync files and folders even if you are not connected to a Wi-Fi network, set *Settings* \> *SYNCHRONIZATION* \> *Automatic Sync Over Cellular* in the SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents app to *On*. If you choose synchronization on Wi-Fi only, you receive a warning if you access files above the defined size limit. Your administrator can set a default file size limit. You cannot set a higher value, but you can lower the limit to a value of your choice. To configure the size threshold for the warning, tap *Automatic Sync Over Cellular*, then tap *Cellular Data Threshold*, and enter the file size in MB.
> 
> Folders that are marked for sync lose their auto-sync setting if these folders are either renamed or moved using the Web client to a parent folder that is not marked for sync.
