# Updating and Sorting the Documents List

The Document Management Service app refreshes the list of documents whenever you navigate to a folder.



## Context

To display changes that have occurred on the server or on your mobile device, you need to update the documents list to view the synchronization result. For files that are marked for offline access and that you have never viewed before or that have been changed after you viewed them, a blue dot before the file name symbolizes the file as unread. In addition, the list displays icons for each file or folder. These icons indicate the synchronization status of a file or folder for which offline synchronization is enabled:

-   No icon: The file or folder has not yet been synchronized.

-   Green arrow on white \(![](images/Icon_Status_Not_Synced_cda72f4.png)\): The file or folder is marked for synchronization but has never been downloaded to the device or has been changed.

-   White arrow on green \(![](images/Icon_Status_Downloaded_ab74587.png)\): The file or folder has been synchronized but might not be up to date if you are offline.

-   Red exclamation mark \(![](images/Icon_Status_Error_3545d3a.png)\): The file cannot be saved, for example, because a virus has been detected or an upload error has occurred.




## Procedure

1.  To manually refresh the list, pull down the list and release it.

2.  To sort the documents list, choose any of the sort criteria.

    Pull down the documents list to display the current sort criterion. To change it, tap it.

    -   The following sort criteria are available in the *Repository* folder:

        *Name*, *Modification Date*, *Creation Date*, *Size*, and *Type*


    By default, the folders are either sorted by modification date or by name.

    You can invert the sort order, for example, for the sort criterion *Name*, by again tapping the same sort criterion.
