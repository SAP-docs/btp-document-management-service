# Uploading Files

You can upload files using the SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents Web app. All files smaller than 5 MB have a preview display. PDFs and images are always displayed with a preview regardless of their size. The 5 MB limit for the preview display only applies to text files.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> The maximum number of files that can be displayed for a single folder is 50,000.

If the share grants write permission to external users but at the same time hides uploaded files from these users \(*Hide uploaded files* checkbox\), then external users cannot see any content in the share even after uploading their files.



## Procedure

1.  To upload files, select the files and drag and drop them into the browser, or choose *Upload* and select the files to upload.

    To directly unpack ZIP files in the *My Documents* and *Corporate* repositories, choose *Upload* and select *Extract ZIP archives on server*.

2.  If the share that you are uploading the files to already contains files with the same name, you must decide whether to *Rename files* or, depending on whether you are working with a versioned or unversioned repository, either *Create new versions* \(versioned\) or *Overwrite files* \(unversioned\).




## Results

During the file upload, a progress message is displayed. To display a detailed progress view, where you can also cancel the action, click the message. Once the action has been executed, a result message is displayed.

If you are out of space, a message is displayed. You cannot upload any more files until you free up some space.
