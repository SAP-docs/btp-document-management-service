# Working with Selected Files in the Documents List

The documents list displays a list of files and subfolders when you access any folder in SAP Document Management Service.



## Prerequisites

-   You've the necessary permissions to execute the given action.




## Procedure

1.  To work on any file or folder, select it:

    Use the checkbox next to the file or folder name.

    > ### Note:  
    > Tapping a file or folder name doesn't select the item. A tap on the name opens a file in full screen mode or, in the case of a folder, displays the documents list of the folder.

    A panel with actions appears: *Open*, *Open In...*, *Send*, *Copy*, *Rename*, *Delete*, and *Share*. In addition, the switch for making a file available offline is available depending on the server settings.

    > ### Note:  
    > Depending on the file type, the most popular actions are also available as swipe actions. In the row of the file, swipe from right to left to display the actions and from left to right to hide them again. For PDF files, for example, these are *Enable Sync*, *Send*, and *Delete*.

2.  Choose one of the actions.

    </table>
    
    In *Synced Documents*, there's also a *Mark All as Read* button \(![](images/iOS_Icon_Mark_All_as_Read_179aef0.png)\). This button removes the blue dot indicating unviewed files and removes the number of unread files that is shown in *Synced Documents*.

    The set of available actions that is displayed depends on the server settings, the device used, the folder in which you're working, and the number and type of files and folders you've selected. In *Repository*, for example, the *Send*, *Share*, and *Delete* actions are available if you select multiple files. If you select multiple folders, only the *Delete* action is available.
