# Adding a Link to a Share

In SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents, you can create shares without a link that anyone can access.



## Context

You may, for example, want to work on the share before inviting any other users. The link for share members is created immediately even if you have not yet invited any members. Once you decide to share the content with non-share members, you can add a link that anyone can access.



## Procedure

1.  To add a link that anyone can access, select the share in the *Shared Documents* repository and choose the *Access Settings of Share* icon \(![](images/Web_Icon_Group_77198e9.png)\).

2.  On the *Access Settings of Share* tab, select *Anyone with the link has access*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you add this link to a share that was formerly marked as a share for members, the member link is replaced with the link that anyone can access in the display where you can copy it.
