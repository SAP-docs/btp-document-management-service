# Using the Pushed Documents Repository \(Android\)

The *Pushed Documents* repository of SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents gives an overview of all pushed documents that are automatically downloaded to your device.



## Context

Administrators can mark any corporate repository that they create as pushed content. In addition, they can restrict access to these repositories to users with certain roles. If you have a *Synced Documents* folder \(marked with this icon ![](images/iOS_Icon_Pushed_Documents_1edeb07.jpg)\) in the list of repositories on your device, the number of unread pushed files on your device is displayed next to it. Unread files are marked with a blue dot before the file name in this overview list, as well as in the repository in which they actually reside.



## Procedure

1.  To work on any file, use the usual actions, for example, open a file by tapping it.

    This marks the file as read.

2.  To mark all files in the *Pushed Documents* repository as read, choose ![](images/Icon_Mark_All_As_Read_8013a9a.png).

    > ### Note:  
    > If you chose to not display the *Mark All as Read* dialog in the future, you can restore the dialog in the app settings by using the *Reset "Don't Ask Me" Warnings* button.

    You can undo this setting for individual files by selecting these files and choosing *Mark as Unread*.
