# Starting the Modern UI and Opening Files

To access files or folders on the Document Management Service Modern UI, you start the app for the first time and select the root folder.



## Procedure

1.  Using the Microsoft Windows app launcher, start the Document Management Service Modern UI by choosing the Document Management Service icon.

2.  If you are starting the app for the first time, specify the *Mobile Docs**Doc Center* root folder as follows:

    1.  Choose *Browse*.

    2.  Navigate to the *Mobile Documents**Doc Center* folder. By default, the location is `C:\\Users\<user_name>\Mobile Docs``C:\\Users\<user_name>\Doc Center`. To check the folderâ€™s location, see the *Root Folder* field on the *Settings* screen of your desktop app.

    3.  Choose *Choose this folder*.

    4.  Choose *OK*.


    The repositories \(*My Documents*, *Shared Documents*, *Corporate Documents*\) that your administrator has configured are displayed. Changes to the repositories are downloaded asynchronously and can only be seen after you update the UI. To refresh the UI, either right-click the screen and choose the *Refresh* button on the app bar or, on a touch screen, swipe upwards from the bottom edge of the app and use the app bar.

3.  To navigate to the repository tree, choose the three dots button.

4.  To open a file, select it and a popup displays the options available for opening the file.
