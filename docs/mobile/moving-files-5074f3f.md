## Context

This section describes the general move and copy actions. If you want to share files and move or copy them to a share, use the *Share* button. For more information, see [Sharing Files](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ba2adb991f6e4b6a857e9f76a99402bd/Cloud/en-US/b391b671601d4b12b9f64ed3a106bb17.html "You can share files with colleagues and business partners by creating a link to a share containing the files you want to share. You can distribute the link by e-mail, instant messaging, or social networks, wherever you want.") :arrow_upper_right:.



## Procedure

1.  To copy or move files, select one or more files within a folder.

2.  Choose *Copy* or *Cut*.

    > ### Caution:  
    > Do not refresh your browser before pasting cut files. Refreshing the browser deletes the buffer where the cut files are kept. In contrast, refreshing the folder using the *Refresh* button does not delete the cut files.

3.  Navigate to the folder where you want to place the files and use *Paste*. If you used *Cut* to select the files, your files are moved. If you used *Copy*, your files are copied.
