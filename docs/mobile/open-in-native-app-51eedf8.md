# Open in Native App

Users can now directly switch from the SAP Document Center Web app to the SAP Document Center native app of their device.



## Prerequisites

The SAP Document Center native app is installed on your device.



## Procedure

1.  In the desktop app, select the file or folder you want to open in the native app.

    If you are inside a folder without selecting anything, the current folder will be opened.

2.  Choose the *Open in *<native app\>**.

    If the Web app runs, for example, on a desktop, the *Open in Desktop* button is available. It opens the selected folder, share, or file in the desktop app. The selected folder or share is then also marked for selective sync in the desktop app settings of the *Selected Sync* tab. For files this sync setting is not set automatically.

    To cancel the *Open in Desktop* action, open the *Open in Desktop from Web* notification that is displayed. Then in the *Notifications* dialog, choose the *Cancel* button displayed next to the respective notification.

    Similar buttons are available for the other SAP Document Center native apps.
