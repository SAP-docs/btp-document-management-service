# Working with Selected Files in the Documents List \(Android\)

The documents list displays a list of files and subfolders when you access any folder in SAP Document Management Service.



## Prerequisites

-   You have the necessary permissions to execute the given action.




## Procedure

1.  To work on any file or folder, select it:

    Long-press the row in the documents list to select the file and to display the action buttons.

    To access the actions on Android phones, choose this icon \(![Android Actions Icon](images/Android_Actions_Icon_ff6c388.png)\). On Android tablets, choose this icon \(![](images/Android_Tablet_Actions_Icon_8134641.jpg)\). Then the following actions are available: *Select*, *Enable Offline Access*, *Delete*, *Rename*, and *Properties*.

    For selected files or folders, some actions have separate buttons with icons, for example, *Mark for Offline Access* \(![](images/Android_Download_Action_8ba937c.png)\), *Sharing* \(![](images/Android_Sharing_Action_e99ff27.png)\), *Send Mail* \(![](images/Android_Mail_Action_38b4e79.png)\), and *Properties* \(![](images/Android_Properties_Action_6ad2c25.png)\). Others are available using the settings icons, for example, *Delete* and *Rename*. To deselect one or more files or folders, choose the checkmark icon.

    > ### Note:  
    > Not all actions are available in all folders. If you select several files or folders, some actions are no longer available.

    In *Synced Documents*, there is also a *Mark All as Read* button \(![](images/iOS_Icon_Mark_All_as_Read_179aef0.png)\). This button removes the blue dot indicating unviewed files and removes the number of unread files that is shown in *Synced Documents*.

    The set of available actions that is displayed depends on the server settings, the device used, the folder in which you are working, and the number and type of files and folders you have selected. In *Repository*, for example, the *Send*, *Share*, and *Delete* actions are available if you select multiple files. If you select multiple folders, only the *Delete* action is available.
