# Starting and Using Executive Mode for iOS

The executive mode of the SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents iOS app is a clear, minimized user interface for viewing shared content.



## Context

The home screen displays all the shares you have created or to which you have been invited as a member. You can open a folder with a tap. The files and folders are automatically downloaded to your device. They can have the following status:

-   ![](images/Icon_Status_Not_Synced_cda72f4.png): Not synced \(only available when your device is online\)
-   ![](images/Icon_Status_Downloaded_ab74587.png): Synced \(available offline\)
-   ![](images/iOS_Unread_Icon_65d1f39.png): New
-   *<blank\>*: Read
-   ![](images/iOS_Read_But_Updated_Icon_deb6d8d.png): Read but the file has been updated since



## Procedure

1.  Open the settings of your iOS device.

2.  Choose the *Mobile Docs**Doc Center* entry.

3.  Set the *Executive Mode* slider to on.

4.  Start your SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents app.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you were already using the SAP Document CenterSAP Mobile Documents app, a popup informs you that all files and folders will be deleted from your device. You can still access them on the server.




## Results

On the home screen, you have the following options:

-   To open a folder, tap it.
-   To change the app settings, tap the settings icon \(![](images/iOS_Icon_Settings_inverted_098f4e8.jpg)\).
