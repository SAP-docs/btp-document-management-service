# Checking Notifications

The desktop app displays notification popups, for example, if it recognizes synchronization or naming conflicts.



<a name="loio0c0b57c6e3fd4d22bf970abefe7c9302__context_N10014_N10011_N10001"/>

## Context

Synchronization conflicts occur, for example, if you change a file concurrently on two devices. Naming conflicts occur, for example, if your local file system does not accept certain characters in file names, for example, question mark \(?\), star \(\*\), slash \(/\), back slash \(\\\), pipe \(|\), quotes \("\), colon \(:\), leading and trailing spaces. Besides receiving popups, you can also access the notifications using the context menu.



## Procedure

1.  To open your notifications, right-click the Document Management Service tray icon \(![](images/SDM_Client_Service_Desktop_Icon_b0aa4d2.png)\) and choose ![](images/Menu_Notifications_Icon_90185e7.png)*Notifications*.

    In the notifications dialog, the latest notification is displayed on top, with an icon indicating the type of issue \(info, warning, conflict\) and its creation date.

2.  In the notifications dialog, choose an action to resolve the issue, for example, *Open Download Page*, *Sync Now* or *Ignore* \(*Ignore* implies that the information for this share will never be shown again.\).




## Results

The notification dialog lists all valid notifications. Outdated notifications, for example, ones for issues, which you have resolved, are deleted automatically.
