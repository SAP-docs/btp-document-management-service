## Procedure

1.  Download and install the Document Management Service app from Google Play. See [SAP Document Management Service app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sap.sdm.android).

2.  Start the app.

3.  If you're installing the app for the first time, you're asked to review and accept an End User License Agreement and Privacy Statement. Click *Agree*.

4.  Configure your account using a QR code.

    1.  On the Android device, choose *Scan*.

    2.  With the camera of the Android device, scan the QR code that is already available with you.

        A confirmation message is displayed.

    3.  Choose *Continue*.

    4.  Authenticate the user by entering their credentials.

        If you're asked to set an app passcode to protect the data stored in the app, enter a passcode containing at least 8 characters. It completely depends on the passcode policy that is set in your SAP Mobile Services instance.

        > ### Caution:  
        > If you forget your passcode, you have to reinstall the app. This means that you have to make your settings again and all synced documents are lost.

        > ### Note:  
        > If you're logged out of the application and need to log back in, then you have the following options:
        > 
        > -   *Use the Current Application*: Choose this option if you've previously onboarded and simply want to access your existing account.
        > 
        > -   *Scan a New QR Code*: Choose this option if you're onboarding for the first time or if your admin has provided a new QR code for login.
