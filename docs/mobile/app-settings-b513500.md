    It allows you to manually search for and install any available updates for the app. When you select this option, the app connects to its designated server to check if there are any newer versions available. If updates are found, you're given the option to download and install them.

    This feature ensures that you have the latest version of the app, which includes bug fixes, security patches, performance improvements, or new features. Keeping your app up-to-date helps maintain its functionality, security, and overall user experience.
