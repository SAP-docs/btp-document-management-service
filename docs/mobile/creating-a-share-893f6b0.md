<a name="loio893f6b0096d54da2ada7ff7791cae904__prereq_N10015_N10012_N10001"/>

## Prerequisites

-   Your administrator has set up a *Shared Documents* repository.
-   Your administrator has set up a combination of confidentiality levels and security policies that allow files to be shared.



## Context

With the Web app, you can create a share for files you selected in *My Documents* or you can create an empty share in *Shared Documents*. Either way, creating a share involves the same steps. For a complete description for sharing files that are located in the *My Documents*, see [Sharing Files](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ba2adb991f6e4b6a857e9f76a99402bd/Cloud/en-US/b391b671601d4b12b9f64ed3a106bb17.html "You can share files with colleagues and business partners by creating a link to a share containing the files you want to share. You can distribute the link by e-mail, instant messaging, or social networks, wherever you want.") :arrow_upper_right:.

To create an empty share, see the steps below.



## Procedure

1.  Open *Shared Documents*, and choose *\+ Create*.

2.  Enter a name for the share.Replace the suggested name *New Share* with a more meaningful name for the share.

    > ### Note:  
    > Be aware that this name is visible to the people you send the link to.

3.  Define the access settings of your share using the following options:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Option
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Anyone with the link has access
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Creates a public share and anyone with the link can access it.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Access expiration date* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Defines when the access to the share expires. If the expiration period times outand you have not defined a date for automatic deletion, the share will not be removed. You as the share owner or a share administrator can access and extend this period.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Delete share permanently after expiration* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    To delete the share permanently after the public link has expired, select *Delete share permanently after expiration*. Then select the period of grace before deletion from the dropdown list.

    > ### Caution:  
    > The share will be deleted permanently and cannot be recovered.

5.  Choose *Save*.

6.  \(Optional\) On the confirmation screen, you can decide to send a mail with the link to the share or copy the link URL.

    Alternatively, you can simply choose *OK* to close the dialog. Later on, you will still be able to locate your share in the *Shared Documents* repository and send a link or open the URL from there using the *Access Settings of Share* icon \(![](images/Web_Icon_Group_77198e9.png)\).

    > ### Note:  
    > Do not send the password together with the URL; use another way of sharing it.

7.  \(Optional\) Add files and folders to your share, for example, using drag&drop.




## Results

The new share is open and you can directly add files and folders to it. After saving the share, you can directly change the share settings with the *i Share Details* button. This is, for example, useful if you want to first prepare the share content and then add users to it.
