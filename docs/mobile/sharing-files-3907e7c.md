# Sharing Files

You can share files with colleagues and business partners by creating a link to a share containing the files you want to share. You can distribute the link by e-mail, instant messaging, or social networks, wherever you want.

## Prerequisites

Your administrator has set up a *Collaboration* enabled repository. See [Onboarding Internal Repository](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8e5c8dd3350245848edf216bf176444c/Dev/en-US/59e3cb769e4f4487a2417d59d65f8276.html "Connect your Document Management Service, Application Option to Document Management Service, Repository Option for file storage.") :arrow_upper_right:.



## Context

You create a share that contains the files you want to share. You can send a public link to users to enable them to access the share as well, and even assign them write permission so that they can change, upload, and delete files. The share is then public and anyone can access it, even if they haven't installed Document Management Service.

The public link is only available for shares and can't link directly to subfolders or files of the share.

> ### Note:  
> Note that if your company uses a user quota to limit the amount of data each user is allowed to store in Document Management Service, the data on the share is assigned to the quota of the share owner. Even if other users upload documents to the share, the quota of the share owner is used.



## Procedure

1.  In the folder containing the files you want to share, select the files to share from the files list and choose *Send* \> *Share*.

    A list of the existing shares to which you're assigned as owner, administrator, or contributor is displayed, as well as the *Create Share* button. If you select a share from the list, a copy of your file is saved in the selected share. Choose *Share* to save the files in this share.

2.  To create a new share, choose *Create Share*.

Your files are displayed in their share in the *Shared Documents* repository.
