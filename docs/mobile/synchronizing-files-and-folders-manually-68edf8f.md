# Synchronizing Files and Folders Manually

The files and folders in your local Document Management Service folder are periodically synchronized with the server, based on the settings you've made.



<a name="loio68edf8f63cbc4915bde2f141f5ffbc90__context_N10014_N10011_N10001"/>

## Context

This means that your data might not be in sync between synchronization runs.



## Procedure

To ensure that your local files and folders are currently in sync with the files on the server, especially if files have been changed on the server by other apps or if the desktop app was offline, right-click the Document Management Service tray icon \(![](images/SDM_Client_Service_Desktop_Icon_b0aa4d2.png)\) and choose ![](images/Menu_Sync_Now_Icon_e82d613.png)*Sync Now*.

If you work in your Explorer \(Windows\) or in Finder \(Mac\), you can directly use *Sync Now* from the context menu. Choose *SAP Document Management Service* \> *Sync Now*.
