# Sorting and Searching

The Document Management Service mobile application UI displays the up-to-date list of files and folders.



## Procedure

1.  To sort the list of files and folders inside a repository, choose one of the <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‚•</span> Sort criteria from the dropdown list:

    -   *Name*
    -   *Object Type*
    -   *Creation Date*
    -   *Modification Date*
    -   *File Size*

    By default, the files and folders are sorted by name, with the folder names before the file names.

2.  To search for a file or folder inside a folder, enter the file or folder name \(or a part of it\) in the :mag: field.
