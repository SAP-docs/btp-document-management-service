# Troubleshooting

Consider the following best practices when troubleshooting errors that occur in your SAP Document Management Service app.



## Uploading New Files Not Possible

**Symptom**

If you want to upload documents but the function simply does not work or the button has disappeared, you have no more space available.

**Solution**

Your administrator assigns space for storing documents to each user. If you have used up all the space that is assigned to you, you can no longer add content to your *Collaboration* repository or - for the cloud version - to the repository.

The SAP Document Management Service apps display messages that the space is used up. In addition, the desktop app tray icon changes \(![](images/SDC_Tray_Icon_Quota_6ecb32b.png)\).

The mobile apps display a message that the space is used up. The function buttons are displayed as usual but will have no effect. So if you choose *Upload*, for example, nothing will happen.

To upload another file, you must free up some space, for example, by removing an uploaded file. You could also use a share owned by another user who still has space left.



## Action Button Inactive

**Symptom**

You want to use an action button, for example, *Share*, but it is grayed out and has a lock icon.

**Solution**

Your administrator has set up document classification and security policies to protect security-relevant documents. As a result, some of the actions are not available in certain repositories.
