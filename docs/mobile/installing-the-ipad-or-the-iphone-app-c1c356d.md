# Installing the iPad or the iPhone App

Before you can use the Document Management Service mobile app on your iOS device, you have to set it up.



## Context

-   Your iOS device has version 12.0 or higher installed.

-   You already have the QR code generated for the server URL. For more information, see [Generating QR Code for Mobile Applications](generating-qr-code-for-mobile-applications-985ec46.md).




## Procedure

1.  Download and install the Document Management Service app from the Apple App Store. See [SAP Document Management Service app on Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/document-management-service/id1593443458).

2.  Start the app.

3.  If you're installing the app for the first time, you're asked to review and accept an End User License Agreement and Privacy Statement. Click *Agree*.

4.  Configure your account using a QR code.

    1.  On the iOS device, choose *Scan*.

    2.  With the camera of the iOS device, scan the QR code that is already available with you.

        A confirmation message is displayed.

    3.  Choose *Continue*.

    4.  Authenticate the user by entering their credentials.

        If you're asked to set an app passcode to protect the data stored in the app, enter a passcode containing at least 8 characters. It completely depends on the passcode policy that is set in your SAP Mobile Services instance.

        > ### Caution:  
        > If you forget your passcode, you have to reinstall the app. This means that you have to make your settings again and all synced documents are lost.
