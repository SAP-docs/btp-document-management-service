# Sharing Files \(Android\)

You can share files with colleagues and business partners by creating a link to a share containing the files you want to share. You can distribute the link by e-mail, instant messaging, or social networks, wherever you want.

## Prerequisites

-   Your administrator has set up a *Collaboration* repository.




## Context

You create a share that contains the files you want to share. You can send a public link to users to enable them to access the share as well, and even assign them write permission so that they can change, upload, and delete files. The share is then public and anyone can access it, even if they have not installed SAP Document Management Service.

The public link is only available for shares and cannot link directly to subfolders or files of the share.

> ### Note:  
> Note that if your company uses a user quota to limit the amount of data each user is allowed to store in SAP Document Management Service, the data on the share is assigned to the quota of the share owner. Even if other users upload documents to the share, the quota of the share owner is used.



## Procedure

1.  In the folder containing the files you want to share, select the files to share from the files list and choose the *Share* icon.

    A list of the existing shares to which you are assigned as owner, administrator, or contributor is displayed, as well as the *Create Share* button. If you select a share from the list, a copy of your file is saved in the selected share. Choose *Share* to save the files in this share.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can also navigate to an existing share and use an existing subfolder of this share to share the files.

2.  To create a new share, choose *Create Share* and enter a name for the new share.

    > ### Note:  
    > Be aware that this name is visible to the people you send the link to.

3.  You have the option of entering a description of the share.

4.  You have the option of increasing or decreasing the proposed validity period for your share, which limits the public availability of your files.

    If your administrator has defined a default validity period for the public link, this interval \(in days\) and the end date are displayed. If your administrator has not defined a validity period, the link is accessible indefinitely. In any case, the maximum validity you can set is the default set by the administrator. If there is no default, you can set any number of days.

    You can set the expiration date by using the input field.

5.  You have the option of assigning a password that other users have to enter to access the folder.

    Depending on what your administrator has configured, a password may be mandatory for sharing. After completing this screen and choosing *Next*, you have to enter and re-enter the password.

6.  You have the option of granting write access so that other users can change and delete files in the shared folder and upload additional files. Your administrator can restrict the use of this setting.

7.  Choose *Create*.

8.  Choose *Share*.

9.  If you have been online while creating the share, you can immediately share the link.
