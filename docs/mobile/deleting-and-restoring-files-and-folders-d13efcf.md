# Deleting and Restoring Files and Folders

You can delete files and folders from the *My Documents*, *Shared Documents*, and *Corporate Documents* repositories.



## Prerequisites

-   You are using SAP Document Center.
-   Your administrator has activated the recycle bin for the respective repository, for example, for *My Documents*.
-   You are authorized to delete or restore files and folders of the specific repository, for example, because you are the owner of the repository.



## Context

You cannot delete shares where you are not the owner or a share administrator. But you can unassign yourself from these shares to make them disappear from your *Shared Documents* folder.



## Procedure

1.  To delete one or more files or folders, select them in the repository's document list, and choose *Delete*.

2.  To restore files or folders from the repository's recycle bin, choose *Recycle Bin* \(![](images/Web_Recycle_Bin_Icon_8c10628.png)\).

    > ### Note:  
    > The *Recycle Bin* button is only available if your administrator has activated a recycle bin for at least one repository.

3.  In the list of all recycle bins, select the one for the repository from which you deleted the object.

4.  Select the files or folders, and choose *Restore*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you restore a file that has been deleted from a share that has also been deleted, the share will also be restored when you restore the file.
