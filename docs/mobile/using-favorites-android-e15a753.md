3.  On the *Choose Destination* screen, either select an existing folder or create a new one to save the new favorite.

4.  Choose *Select*.

    -   To access a favorite, tap it. Folders will display the documents list, files will open directly.

    -   If you delete a folder, the favorites to it are not automatically deleted. If you select such a favorite, then an error message displays.
