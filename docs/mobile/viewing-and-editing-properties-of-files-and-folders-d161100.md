# Viewing and Editing Properties of Files and Folders

In the SAP Document Management Service mobile app you can view the properties of a file or a folder and edit some of these properties.



## Context

The CMIS standard defines which of the general properties can be edited and the server administrator determines which of the custom properties can be edited. The file and folder properties are grouped into the following categories:

-   *General Properties*

    The *General Properties* provide the following information about a file or a folder:

    -   Description and type
    -   Size
    -   Classification \(public, customer, internal, confidential, or strictly confidential\)
    -   Date of creation
    -   Author
    -   Date of modification
    -   Editor

-   *Custom Properties*

    The *Custom Properties* provide more technical details, which depend on the repository and are grouped by namespace and secondary type.

## Procedure

1.  To view the properties of a file or a folder, do the following:

    -   On iPad: Select the checkbox next to the file or folder. The general properties are displayed under the action buttons. To access the custom properties, choose the *Custom Properties* button. This replaces the documents list with the custom properties.
    -   On iPhone: Select the checkbox next to the file or folder and choose the *Properties* button. To access the custom properties, choose the *Custom Properties* button. This displays the custom properties instead of the general properties.

2.  To edit the description or the properties of a file or folder, view its description or properties and switch to edit mode by choosing *Edit* .

3.  Save your changes by choosing *Done*.
