# Generating Thumbnail

Enable thumbnails if you've activated the thumbnail feature after onboarding the internal repository.



<a name="loioc6de2be9113948d7814f9222acead91f__prereq_rnf_4tv_txb"/>

## Prerequisites

You've selected the *Enable Thumbnail* option in your internal repository and synced repositories metadata. See [Update Document Management Service's Repository](../../web-app-guide/update-document-management-service-s-repository-c747795.md).



## Context

Thumbnails for the document are required to identify it quickly. It can help you to easily categorize documents.

The Generate Thumbnail feature is available for repositories that are onboarded without selecting the Thumbnail option at the time of onboarding the repository. It's available only for older repositories or you enable the thumbnail option post onboarding of the repositories typically known as older repositories. You can enable thumbnail post onboarding of repositories using the Generate Thumbnail feature. The feature helps users to create a thumbnail for the documents in the onboarded repositories.

> ### Remember:  
> The *Thumbnail* and *Encryption* features are independent. Hence, you can't enable both options at a time. You can select either of the one, which means the thumbnail won't support encryption-enabled repositories. However, you won't be able to view thumbnails of the files in the encrypted repository.



## Procedure

1.  Open an internal repository, select the document, and choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‡²</span> More Options.

2.  Choose *Generate Thumbnail*.

    Thumbnail generation is accepted and it takes a few minutes for the thumbnail to appear on the user interface.
