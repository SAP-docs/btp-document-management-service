## Document Management Service, Integration Option

-   Document Management Service, Integration Option is a Platform as a Service \(PaaS\) offering.

-   The solution is appropriate for companies who want to integrate document management capabilities into their business applications.

-   It offers APIs that allow any leading business application to consume it.

-   It also offers a reusable UI that can be integrated into any leading SAP Fiori applications.

## Document Management Service, Application Option

-   It's a Software as a Service \(SaaS\) offering.

-   The solution is appropriate for businesses who want to implement a ready-to-use application.

-   It's not possible to use API straight from the Document Management Service, Application Option. In such cases, we must link application option-created repositories to an integration option instance.

-   Document Management Service, Integration Option is included with Document Management Service, Application Option.
-   The Document Management Service, Application Option option only provides API access to a CMIS-compliant repository and doesn't include any storage.



Along with the two primary options, Document Management Service also includes an optional repository option for storing documents in the cloud.

## Document Management Service, Repository Option

-   It's a purely optional service. If you require storage, you can purchase it.

-   As it's a commercial entitlement, no tiles appear in the cloud cockpit. In your subaccount, you can include the Document Management Service, Repository Option entitlement.

-   The Document Management Service, Repository Option can't be used as a stand-alone. It must be used with one of two options: Document Management Service, Application Option or Document Management Service, Integration Option.
