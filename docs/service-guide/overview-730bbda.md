# Overview

Explore the world of SAP Document Management Service: The Document Management Service concept, the design, the technology, and various options.

The Document Management Service helps you in the management of your business's documents. It's based on the OASIS \(Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards\) industry standard CMIS \(Content Management Interoperability Services\) and includes features like versioning, hierarchies, access control, and document management.

For your business apps, Document Management Service provides API and UI-based document management capabilities.

Document Management Service is available in two different options, including Document Management Service, Application Option, which is our SaaS offering, andDocument Management Service, Integration Option, which is our PaaS offering.

You can also specify the storage location where your documents are saved with the Document Management Service. You can either use our own repository option and store the data in the SAP cloud data centers, or you can use your own CMIS-compliant repositories, such as OpenText or SAP S/4HANA DMS.
