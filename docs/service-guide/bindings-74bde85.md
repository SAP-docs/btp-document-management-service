# Bindings

Document Management Service, Integration Option supports two of the three binding types defined in CMIS 1.1: the AtomPub and the JSON-based browser binding.

This means that you can connect apps with both bindings. It also means that you can connect repositories to the server that offer one of the two binding types. If you are developing a new app or an extension, opt for the new browser binding if it is technically feasible, since it has better performance.

For more information about the bindings, see the CMIS 1.1 specifications for *AtomPub Binding* and *Browser Binding*.
