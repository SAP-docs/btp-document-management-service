## Context

There are different ways to export content from your repositories, and you can use any of them. For example, you could use an option that is available in the UI itself. To get started, choose one of the following steps:



## Procedure

1.  Get access to the repository via API. For more information about accessing repositories, see [Access Document Management Service, Application Option Repository Using API](../web-app-guide/access-document-management-service-application-option-repository-using-api-e5f4e59.md). After successfully connecting to the repositories, use the `Fetch Repository` API published on [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/api/ServiceApi/overview) to export the metadata of the repositories.

2.  Use the *Download* feature within the user interface \(UI\) to effortlessly retrieve the documents you need. This option allows you to select multiple files simultaneously, streamlining bulk downloads.
