# Offboard Document Management Service, Integration Option

Offboard the repositories that you added to Document Management Service, Integration Option and delete your service instance.



## Context

Offboarding is a two-step process. First, remove the connection that you established between your repositories and Document Management Service, Integration Option. Later, in the SAP BTP cockpit, delete your instance of Document Management Service, Integration Option.

By removing the connection to your repository, you only unlink the connection. You don't delete the content.
