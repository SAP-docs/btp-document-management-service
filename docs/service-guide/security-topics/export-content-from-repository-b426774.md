# Export Content from Repository

Use CMIS workbench to export content from your repository.



## Procedure

1.  Download the Chemistry Workbench from the Apache Web site and connect to your repository.

2.  Download the content of your repository to your local computer.

    > ### Note:  
    > To set up automated batch operations, you can use *Console* in the CMIS workbench. You can create scripts that perform queries to filter your content or you can download selective folders only. As starting point, have a look at the sample scripts that are available in the *Console* menu.

    > ### Remember:  
    > REST-based APIs now let you off-board your repository as well as check the status of offboarding and download the repository data.
    > 
    > Refer to an API published on [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/api/AdminAPI/resource).
