## Context

As an administrator, you can download content from repositories using a desktop client. It involves using an application to access and retrieve files stored in your repositories. The desktop client lets you connect to the repositories, browse the content, and download files locally.



## Procedure

1.  Download the installation package for your chosen desktop client. For more information about installing desktop clients, see [Working With the Mobile Apps (Old)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/774c31c426df4fee9cbdcee9bbd876f8/Dev/en-US/c584be72204a4ec2a7b18f35dc95eb6e.html "The various SAP Document Management Service applications (apps) need to be installed before you can use them on your devices.") :arrow_upper_right:.

2.  Launch the desktop client and configure it to access the repository you want to download content from. It typically involves providing the repository URL, authentication credentials if necessary, and any other relevant settings.

3.  Once you've configured access to the repository, you can browse its contents within the desktop client interface.

4.  Once you've found the contents that you want to download, select them within the desktop client interface. Choose *Download* to initiate the download process.

5.  Choose a location on your local machine where you want to save the downloaded files.
