## Prerequisites

-   You've assigned an administrator authorization with the role template `SAP_BC_CMIS_FS_ADMIN (from 7.58 SP1)` and ensure that you've included the authorization `S_FSC_ADM`. For more information, see [SAP Note 3432542 - Template Role For File Share Configuration](https://me.sap.com/notes/3432542/E).



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP Fiori Launchpad.

2.  Search for the *Secure File Share Configuration* app from the SAP Fiori Launchpad. Or open transaction `WDA0146`.

3.  Add a new *File Share* configuration and follow the sub-steps:

    1.  Choose *Create new File Share*.

    2.  In the step *Details*, select a unique *ID* and *Description* and set the *Server* and *File Share Type*.

    3.  Next in step **Connection**, add the *File Share Destination* and if necessary *File Share Administration Destination*, created in the previous section \(Create a Destination in ABAP System Using Transaction SM59\). Use the *Check Connection* button to confirm the functionality of your destinations.

    4.  In step **Repository**, select the *Repository ID* as created in the SAP Document Management service and its *Root*.

    5.  Check the information in *Summary*, perform checks if needed, and *Finish* the creation.


4.  If the required File Share exists and needs to be changed, go back to the *Secure File Share Configuration* app and adapt the fields by following the sub-steps:

    1.  Choose *Edit*.

    2.  Change the settings that have to be changed.

        > ### Note:  
        > If the File Share is already actively used, not all fields can be changed anymore.

    3.  Choose *Save*.


5.  Perform tests on field values, connections to destinations, and the File Share using the *Check File Share* option available within the app.

6.  A *File Share*configuration consists of the following information:
