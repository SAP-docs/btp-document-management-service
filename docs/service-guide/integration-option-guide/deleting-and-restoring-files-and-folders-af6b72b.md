# Deleting and Restoring Files and Folders

You can delete files and folders from the Document Management Service repositories.



## Procedure

1.  To delete one or more files or folders, select them in the repository's document list, and choose *Delete*.

2.  To restore files or folders from the repository's recycle bin, choose :wastebasket:.

3.  Select the files or folders, and choose *Restore*.

    > ### Note:  
    > -   In addition, you can also permanently delete selected files and folders or all content from a repository recycle bin.
    > 
    > -   It's only possible to restore items deleted from the root of the recycle bin as subfolder restoration isn't permitted.
    > 
    > -   If both share and documents are deleted together, the share must be restored first. The fact that this share is also restored when the files are restored isn't correct.
    > 
    > -   When you delete versions of a document directly by selecting the delete option and you can't restore them from the recycle bin because deleting them directly from the version section is treated as a permanent delete.
