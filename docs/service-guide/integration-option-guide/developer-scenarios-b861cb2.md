# Developer Scenarios

Build document management capabilities for your business applications.

The typical workflow in developing document management capabilities involves:

1.  Creating an instance of Document Management Service, Integration Option and binding it to your application. See [Creating a Service Instance and Service Key](creating-a-service-instance-and-service-key-fe7f1e5.md).

2.  Adding Document Management Service, Integration Option as dependency in your SaaS provisioning service.

3.  Onboarding repositories â€“ connecting to your own CMIS-compliant repository or Document Management Service, Repository Option. See [Manage Document Management Service, Integration Option](manage-document-management-service-integration-option-64fa80a.md).

4.  Consuming the capabilities of Document Management Service, Integration Option, which you can achieve in different ways:

    -   Build custom document-management capabilities using client credential flow

    -   Build custom document-management capabilities using user-token exchange flow

    -   Consume and embed an easy-to-use reuse UI
