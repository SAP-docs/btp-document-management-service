# Document Classification

As an administrator, you can use the document classification option to categorize documents based on the level of confidentiality in the SAP Document Management service, application option.

This option allows you to classify documents according to your organization's security policies. This is done by assigning a classification level to each document and ensuring that users have access to documents with a specified level of classification.

SAP Document Management service, application option enables you to access important documents in a secure way. To enhance security, the service offers the capability to enforce a secure classification option for all the documents available in the repository. By leveraging this feature, you can ensure that sensitive documents are shared based on confidentiality and that users are able to access the documents and work on them based on the level of classification that has been set for the documents. As the creator of the document, you can assign the level of classification to the document but it's completely the user's responsibility to comply with the classification assigned.

> ### Note:  
> The SAP Document Management Service can only guide the users by providing a security-compliant solution. It can't prevent the intentional violation of security policies by users, for example, by taking screenshots.

The document classification supports a fixed set of security classifications for repositories only. You can classify the confidentiality level for one or all repositories by choosing one of the predefined confidentiality levels in the settings of the administration UI:

-   Strictly Confidential
-   Confidential
-   Internal
-   Customer
-   Public

> ### Note:  
> -   It's a one-time setting that needs to be enabled. You can't disable it once you've enabled it.
> 
> -   There's no default classification available. To set it, you must choose the classification tab via the actions on the UI.
