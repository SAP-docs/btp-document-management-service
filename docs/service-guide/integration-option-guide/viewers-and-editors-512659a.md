# Viewers and Editors

Depending on the file type, clicking the file opens a preview or downloads the file.





### Inline viewers for preview

Preview the file types that follow using the inline viewer:

-   Images \(jpg, png, bmp, gif\)

-   PDF

-   Text files

-   VDS files \(Visual Design Stream - certain 3D files\)




### View and edit MS Office documents

Document Management Service provides integration with Office 365 that directly launches MS Office applications from the browser. Hence, you can view your MS Office documents in the respective MS Office applications without having to download them.

> ### Note:  
> There is no support for the `*.msg` file type, as well as other Outlook files, for viewing.

To edit documents, you must have editing permission. Without necessary permission, you can view such files.



### Navigate across documents

For documents that are placed within same hierarchy, the previewer can be used to navigate the documents instead of closing the current preview and opening the other document every time.



### Other file types

For other file extensions that arenâ€™t mentioned, Document Management Service provides an option to download the documents to view them.
