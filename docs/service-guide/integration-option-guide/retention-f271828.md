## Prerequisites

You've provided the `sdmbusinessadmin` role. For more information, see [Authorizations](authorizations-669d25c.md).



## Context

A Retention is the period of time during which a document is deleted. A retention policy is currently in place for documents only. Retention is available at header of managing documents menu.

> ### Remember:  
> -   The *Retention* setting can only be applied to documents, not folders.
> 
> -   Upon setting *Retention*, the property attributes of a particular document cannot be modified.
> 
> -   It's mandatory to set the *Expiration Date* if you want to apply retention.
> 
> -   The *Destruction Date* must be greater than or equal to the *Expiration Date*, it can't be less than the *Expiration Date*.
> 
> -   When a *Destruction Date* and *Expiration Date* are set, they can't be removed or preponed. They can only be postponed until a future date.
> 
> -   The *Expiration Date* and *Destruction Date* must be greater than the current timestamp, so it can't be in the past.
> 
> -   It's mandatory to set the *Expiration Date* when you set destruction.
