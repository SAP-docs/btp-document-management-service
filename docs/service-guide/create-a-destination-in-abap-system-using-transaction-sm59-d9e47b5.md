## Prerequisites

You've created a OAuth 2.0 client and copied the *Profile* and *Configuration Name*. For more information, see [Setting Up SAML Outbound OAuth Configuration Between SAP S/4HANA \(On Premise\) And SAP BTP](setting-up-saml-outbound-oauth-configuration-between-sap-s-4hana-on-premise-and-sap-btp-699a106.md).



## Procedure

1.  Open the transaction SM59.

2.  Choose *Create*, to create a new destination.

    1.  Enter *Destination* name as per your choice. The name must begin with the letter 'Z'. For example, `ZCA325_SAP_COM_0190_0002`.

    2.  Select *Connection Type* as *G HTTP connection to external server*.

    3.  Choose :heavy_check_mark:button.


3.  Navigate to the *Technical Settings*, enter the following details:

    1.  *<Host\>*: first URL from service key \(without *https://*\). For example, `api-ddd-ai-gw.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com`
    2.  *<Port\>*: `443`
    3.  *<Path Prefix\>*: */browser*

4.  Navigate to the *Logon & Security* tab, perform the following steps:

    1.  Choose *OAuth Settings*.

    2.  Click on <span class="SAP-icons">î‡³</span> value-helpicon.

    3.  Choose *Profl* that you created.

    4.  Scroll down to *Security Options*. Set the *<SSL\>* client to `Active` and select *DFAULT SSL Client \(Standard\)* as default settings.


5.  Choose :floppy_disk: to save the destination.

6.  Choose the *Connection Test* option at the top of the page, and ignore warning message. The returned HTTP status should be ***200***.

    When you run the *Connection Test*, the *Response Text* section shows ***200 OK*** as the response code, as well as the repositories that have been onboarded for the connected service instance.
