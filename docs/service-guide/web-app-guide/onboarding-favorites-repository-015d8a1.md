## Prerequisites

-   The global administrator of your SAP BTP sub account has added the service plan for Document Management Service, Repository Option to your subaccount via entitlements. See [Configure Entitlements for Subaccounts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/5ba357b4fa1e4de4b9fcc4ae771609da.html).

-   You've admin roles assigned to your user profile.




## Context

Files and folders can be marked as favorites using the favorite feature of the Document Management Service, Application Option. You can easily access it from your favorites folder. When using favorites, it's easier to locate the documents rather than saving them for later use.



## Procedure

1.  Open the Document Management Service admin view.

2.  Choose :heavy_plus_sign: *Add Repository*.

3.  In the *Add Repository* dialog box, choose *Favorites*.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can onboard only one favorite repository.

4.  Choose *Add*.

    A favorites repository has been created and appears in the repository list.
