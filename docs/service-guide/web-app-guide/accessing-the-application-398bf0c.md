## Prerequisites

[Configuring User Access](configuring-user-access-66e4071.md) is completed.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to your subaccount.

2.  In the left pane, choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*.

3.  Search for the *Document Management Service, Application Option*.

4.  Select <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> More Options and choose *Go to Application*.

5.  Log on with the credentials that you provided in the ID Service.

    You see that a portal comes up with three different cards – *Document Management Service* that takes you to the web application for managing files and folders, *Document Management Service Admin* that helps the admin to manage repositories, and *Document Management Service Migration* to manage migration scenarios.

    A user without admin capabilities only sees the *Document Management Service* view card.
