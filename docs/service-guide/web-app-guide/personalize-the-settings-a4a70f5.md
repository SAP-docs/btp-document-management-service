# Personalize the Settings

Use the *Settings* feature to maintain your launchpad settings.



## Context

You can find, view, and change the visual appearance of your app, such as the theme, and configure various functional aspects.

> ### Note:  
> Some settings are read-only and cannot be changed directly in the *Settings*Â dialog. You may also not see all the settings; they may either be disabled by your administrator or not supported on your platform.

Change your launchpad theme and display settings.

Various themes are predefined to assist you with various color and vision preferences.

When using a hybrid device that combines touch and mouse events, you can turn on the *Optimized for Touch Input* feature which increases the size and spacing of the controls on your screen so they are easier to use at your fingertips.

When you work with the Quartz or Horizon theme, you can use the dark mode features on the launchpad. When you use a browser that supports automatic color scheme detection \(e.g. Google Chrome in a current version\), the current dark mode setting in your operating system settings will be reflected in your launchpad. Activate *Dark Mode* to enable or disable automatic dark mode detection on the launchpad. If you use a browser that does not support automatic color scheme detection, you can select a dark theme instead. Note that your administrator can disable this feature.

*Home Page*

</td>
<td valign="top">

The group selection bar at the top of the home page appears identical for both options; however, they behave differently:

-   *Show all content*: Behaves like an anchor bar; choosing a group at the top of the home page scrolls to the content assigned to the group.

-   *Show one group at a time*: Behaves like a tab bar; choosing a group displays the content assigned to the group.


For large amounts of apps, showing one group at a time may be better.

View your login language, as well as date and time formats.

If the administrator has allowed it, you can select a different language for the launchpad and select your preferred date and time formats.

## Procedure

1.  To access the settings, choose the user actions menu and select *Settings*.

    A settings dialog opens for each of the relevant settings that you want to view or edit.

2.  In your *User Account*, you can access your account settings.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can find *Reset All Personalization* option in your *User Account*. Using this option will delete your personalization settings for the launchpad \(e.g. theme, language, user activities, and home page content\) and for apps using the launchpad personalization features \(e.g. filter settings, table columns\). This action is irreversible. Further changes to the dialog will not be applied.

3.  In *Appearance*, choose *Theme* and select various available themes depending on your preferences.

4.  In the *Home Page*, choose whether to show the content of all your groups all at once on the home page or to show only one group at a time.

5.  In the *Language & Region*, select the language as per your preference from the dropdown menu.

6.  Choose *Save*.
