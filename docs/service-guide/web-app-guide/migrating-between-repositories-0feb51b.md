## Context

In the migration tool, you can use migration between repositories option, which allows you to copy or move from one repository \(consisting of files, folders, or a combination of both\) to another. It also supports copying a single document. This feature is useful for organizations that need to transfer large amounts of data quickly and securely.



## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the *Document Management Migration* view.

2.  Choose :heavy_plus_sign: icon.

3.  In the dialog box that appears, choose *Between Repositories* option.

4.  Choose *Destination Name* from the drop-down.

5.  In the *Source Repository* section, enter the following details:

    1.  Enter source *Repository ID*. It's the unique ID of the repository that you want to migrate from the source repository.

    2.  Enter source *Object ID*. It's the ID of the source object of the folder or document that you want to migrate.


    > ### Note:  
    > You can copy the *Repository ID* and *Object ID* from the web link of the particular folder or file.

6.  In the *Target Repository* section, enter the following details:

    1.  Enter target *Repository ID*. It's the unique ID of the repository that you want to migrate to the target repository.

    2.  Enter target *Object ID*. It's the ID of the target object of the folder or document.


7.  Choose *Migrate*.

    Wait for the migration to complete. Depending on the size of the repository, migration can take some time. You can see the current status by refreshing the table.
