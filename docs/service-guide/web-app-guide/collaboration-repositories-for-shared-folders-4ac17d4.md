# Collaboration Repositories for Shared Folders

Learn about the features of collaboration repositories.





### What is a Collaboration Repository?

A collaboration repository offers the capability to create shared folders that can be used for collaboration. As an admin, you can create collaboration repositories by enabling the *Collaboration* option while connecting to Document Management Service, Repository Option. In collaboration repositories, a user \(share owner\) can create folders that can be used to collaborate by inviting other users \(share members\) and managing access rights.



### Collaboration Repository Capabilities

-   All members of the collaboration repository can create shared folders and normal folders.

-   Users can create shared folders, normal folders, and documents inside a collaboration repository.

-   Users can create a shared folder only in the root folder. It isnâ€™t possible to create shared folders inside normal folders or other shared folders.

-   Folders and documents created inside a shared folder behave and operate in the same way as it was in normal repositories.




### Shared Folder Capabilities

-   User who creates the shared folder is the default owner of that folder.

-   Owner of the shared folder can add members to collaborate.

-   Owner of the shared folder can manage the access rights for the members.

-   Folders and documents inside a shared folder inherits the access right of the parent shared folder.

-   Owner of the shared folder can delete the share and its contents.




### Access Control

-   Owners of shared folders can control the access by editing the properties of the shared folders. See [Create a Shared Folder and Define Its Access](../integration-option-guide/create-a-shared-folder-and-define-its-access-1ceb1c8.md). The available roles are:
