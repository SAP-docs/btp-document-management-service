# Overview of Content Management Interoperability Service

Document Management Service is exposed using the OASIS standard protocol Content Management Interoperability Service \(CMIS\).

The CMIS standard defines the protocol level \(SOAP, AtomPub, and JSON-based protocols\). Document Management Service provides a document service client API on top of this protocol for easier consumption. This API is the Open Source library OpenCMIS provided by the Apache Chemistry Project.
