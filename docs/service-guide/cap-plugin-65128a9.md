# CAP Plugin

Use SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) Plugin with SAP Document Management Service.

The [cap-js/sdm](https://github.com/cap-js/sdm) package operates as a [CDS Plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-plugins#cds-plugin-packages), its primary role being the provision of a simplified CAP-level integration route with SAP Document Management Service.

This plugin allows you to store and manage various documents as attachments in a centralized location called the Document Management Repository.
