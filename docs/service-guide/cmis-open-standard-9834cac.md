# CMIS Open Standard

Content Management Interoperability Services \(CMIS\) is an open standard that defines a common interface for various operations offered by content management systems. CMIS defines a domain model and operations for different binding types.



CMIS is language-independent, which gives it a significant advantage over other specifications, and many vendors offer \(or are going to offer\) CMIS interfaces to their systems. In addition, CMIS client libraries already exist in different programming languages. Many of them are available as Open Source implementations under the umbrella project Apache Chemistry. Document Management Service, Integration Option uses the Chemistry components for both app and server implementations.



## Prerequisites for Developers

To develop an app or to integrate the functions of Document Management Service, Integration Option, developers need to familiarize themselves with CMIS and Apache Chemistry.

Apache Chemistry supports open-source implementations of CMIS for Java, Python, PHP, .NET, etc.
