# Integrating SAP S/4HANA with Google Workspace Using SAP Document Management Service

Google Workspace includes Google Drive as one of its productivity applications. You can integrate Google Drive as a file share with SAP Document Management Service. Google documents can be opened in a web browser using Google UI. Create, read, update, and delete \(CRUD\) operations can be performed on your Google documents and folders through this integration.

Your businesses can use Google Drive integration with SAP Document Management Service to maximize their workflow efficiency and store their documents. For the integration between Google Drive and SAP Document Management Service, you need a Google Workspace account.
