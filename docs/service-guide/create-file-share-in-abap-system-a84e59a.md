Configure the File Shares using the Secure File Share Configuration app to ensure the functionality of the File Share operations.



<a name="loioa84e59ada1294aff8acf2bc72f0ff8a3__section_j45_yxm_cbc"/>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, verify that your system meets the following prerequisites:

-   You've completed the previous task. For more information, see [Create a Destination in ABAP System Using Transaction SM59](create-a-destination-in-abap-system-using-transaction-sm59-d9e47b5.md).

-   For `SAP_BASIS >= 7.58 SP01`: You've assigned an administrator authorization with the role template `SAP_BC_CMIS_FS_ADMIN (from 7.58 SP01)` and ensure that you've included the authorization `S_FSC_ADM`. For more information, see [SAP Note 3432542 - Template Role For File Share Configuration](https://me.sap.com/notes/3432542/E).

## Procedure for SAP\_BASIS <= 7.58 SP00

Run the transaction to complete the configuration in the ABAP on-premise environment.

1.  Open the transaction `V_CMIS_L_FS`.
2.  Enter the *File Share ID* as per your requirements. The name must begin with the letter 'Z'. For example, `ZTEST2`.
3.  In the *File Share* dialog, enter the following details:

## Procedure for SAP\_BASIS \>= 7.58 SP01

Follow these steps to successfully setup file share.

1.  Log on to the SAP Fiori Launchpad.
2.  Search for the *Manage File Share Configuration* \(previously*: Secure File Share Configuration*\) app from the SAP Fiori Launchpad. Or open transaction `WDA0146`.
3.  Add a new *File Share* configuration and follow the sub-steps:
    1.  Choose *Create new File Share*.
    2.  In the step *Details*, select a unique *ID* and *Description* and set the *Server* and *File Share Type*.
    3.  Next in the step **Connection**, add the *File Share Destination* and if necessary *File Share Administration Destination*, created in the previous section \([Create a Destination in ABAP System Using Transaction SM59](create-a-destination-in-abap-system-using-transaction-sm59-d9e47b5.md)\). Use the *Check Connection* button to confirm the functionality of your destinations.
    4.  In step **Repository**, select the *Repository ID* as created in the SAP Document Management service and its *Root*.
    5.  Check the information in *Summary*, perform checks if needed, and *Finish* the creation.

4.  If the required File Share exists and needs to be changed, go back to the *Manage File Share Configuration* \(previously*: Secure File Share Configuration*\) app and adapt the fields by following the sub-steps:
    1.  Choose *Edit*.
    2.  Change the settings that have to be changed.

        > ### Note:  
        > If the File Share is already actively used, not all fields can be changed anymore.

    3.  Choose *Save*.

5.  Perform tests on field values, connections to destinations, and the File Share using the *Check File Share* option available within the app.
6.  A *File Share*configuration consists of the following information:
