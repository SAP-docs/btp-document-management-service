# Contributions to the SAP Document Management Service documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our official documentation on SAP Help Portal. The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right markdown file to contribute to.

You can make contributions to the following guides in this repository:

* [SAP Document Management Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service/sap-document-management-service/what-is-document-management-service?version=Cloud)
* [Using SAP Document Management Service Applications](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service/using-sap-document-management-service-applications/sap-document-management-service-user-guide)
